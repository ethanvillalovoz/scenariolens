# ScenarioLens Lane-Continuation Topology Gap Audit

This audit works down the branch coverage queue's topology/parser blockers. For each topology-audit replay case, ScenarioLens reloads the local source slice, compares the capped ScenarioLens map features against raw parsed map-feature ids, and asks whether missing lane-link targets are recoverable by improving map materialization.

The report is intentionally narrow: it does not change the default baseline, does not publish raw map geometry, and is not a Waymo benchmark claim.

## Interpretation

- Cap-recovered cases mean a referenced lane target from beyond the raw feature cap is now available in the capped ScenarioLens map feature set.
- Cap-recoverable cases mean the referenced lane target exists in the raw parsed map but was not available inside the capped ScenarioLens map feature set.
- Terminal-lane confirmations mean the selected lane has no parsed continuation in either the capped or raw parsed map; these need selected-lane or topology-neighborhood work rather than a simple cap increase.
- Raw-missing targets stay parser/proto-source audits until the referenced id can be found.
- This audit turns topology blockers into engineering tasks before expanding branch-selection and route-context guard claims.
