# Scenario Explorer Demo

This directory contains the static Scenario Explorer dashboard and its data
contract.

Open locally with:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000 --directory docs
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000`. The `docs/index.html` entrypoint redirects
to this explorer.

The production copy is embedded in Ethan's personal portfolio site at
`https://ethanvillalovoz.com/scenariolens/`.

The demo data is intentionally small: synthetic scenarios plus tiny
Waymo Motion-shaped fixtures. Each scenario includes interaction-risk metrics,
a constant-velocity prediction baseline, and lane-aware comparison fields when
map context is available so the explorer can surface cases where a simple
forecast fails. See
[`docs/data_provenance.md`](../data_provenance.md) for the exact data status.
See [`docs/project_strategy.md`](../project_strategy.md) for the product goal
and [`docs/architecture.md`](../architecture.md) for the data-flow map.
The Explorer also embeds a public-safe case-diagnostics slice from the local
100-scenario heading-aware lane-selection study: top improvements, regressions,
and fallback-heavy cases, with raw Waymo records and derived packets excluded.
The diagnostics panel links to the public heading-aware debug casebook, while
local SVG overlays and per-case manifests remain ignored under `data/processed/`.
The report rail also links to the heading-aware replay candidate plan,
heading-aware replay prototype, expanded lane-continuation topology gap audit,
expanded terminal-neighborhood audit, expanded terminal replay gate, and
expanded terminal selector experiment, calibration, and visual casebook,
plus the generated v1 evidence index, 200-scenario
continuation/terminal-selector scale-up, and selector
transfer/error/route-context/candidate validation and visual decision atlas,
connecting those cases to public-safe selector stability, topology coverage,
and repo-readiness checks.

Generated files:

- `index.html`: static dashboard shell.
- `styles.css`: dashboard visual system.
- `app.js`: filtering, sorting, and detail-panel interactions.
- `scenarios.json`: ranked dashboard payload.
- `evidence_index.json`: generated v1 public evidence spine used to verify
  the demo, reports, provenance docs, and CI artifacts.
- `selector_decisions.json`: public-safe terminal-selector decision atlas
  payload joined to the 200-scenario candidate-validation labels.
- `assets/*.svg`: trajectory views referenced by `scenarios.json`.
- `assets/terminal_selector_casebook_200_*.svg`: derived selector decision
  cards referenced by `selector_decisions.json`.
- `assets/scenariolens-explorer.png`: README screenshot of the dashboard.
- `assets/scenariolens-demo.gif`: short README demo loop showing filtering,
  trajectory inspection, and baseline comparison.
- The evidence band, baseline-failure card, heading-aware case diagnostics, and
  terminal-selector decision atlas are code-native UI backed by checked-in JSON.

The explorer also links to
[`docs/reports/waymo_motion_case_study.md`](../reports/waymo_motion_case_study.md)
as the public-safe summary of the local real Waymo Motion smoke test.
The first viewport links to the failure study, cross-shard stability study,
v1 evidence index, shard expansion plan, map/signal context study, real lane-aware cross-shard
diagnostic, context-joined failure study, context evaluation set,
context eval debug casebook, context replay candidate plan, context open-loop

## Payload Shape

`scenarios.json` uses format `scenariolens.dashboard.v1` and includes:

- dataset summaries,
- available filter values,
- ranked scenarios,
- score totals and component scores,
- raw and scored-context metrics used in ranking,
- constant-velocity baseline ADE/FDE, miss rate, target source, and failure score,
- lane-aware ADE/FDE, miss rate, FDE improvement, map-used count, and fallback count,
- lane-aware fallback reason summaries,
- public-safe heading-aware lane-selection case diagnostics when a study
  manifest is available,
- public report and debug-casebook links for the heading-aware diagnostics,
- Waymo metadata credibility fields such as SDC presence, prediction targets,
  and objects of interest when available,
- taxonomy tags,
- explanation reasons,
- SVG asset paths,
- basic track metadata.

`selector_decisions.json` uses format
`scenariolens.lane_continuation_terminal_neighborhood_selector_decision_atlas.v1`
and includes the 7 public-safe selector cards, candidate-validation categories,
agreement counts, recovered false-hold count, negative controls, and copied SVG
asset paths. It does not include raw Waymo records, raw trajectories, or raw map
geometry.

`evidence_index.json` uses format `scenariolens.evidence_index.v1` and includes
the generated v1 artifact catalog, stage summaries, required-file readiness,
proof types, commands, public-safe data status notes, and limitations. It
verifies repository artifacts only; it does not require local raw Waymo shards.

The payload is deterministic and does not include timestamps, so it can be
checked into git and reviewed in pull requests.
