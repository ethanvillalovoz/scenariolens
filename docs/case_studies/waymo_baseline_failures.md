# Case Study: Finding Baseline Motion-Prediction Failures

This case study is the recruiter-facing technical story for ScenarioLens.

## Question

Which Waymo Motion scenarios are most useful for evaluating a simple
motion-prediction baseline?

## Method

ScenarioLens loads a local Waymo Motion validation shard, extracts the fields
needed for motion analysis, evaluates a constant-velocity baseline on prediction
targets, and groups the results by scenario tags and score components.

The public report avoids raw gated data. It publishes aggregate statistics,
scenario IDs, tags, and reproducible commands.

## Current Evidence

- Real-slice failure study:
  [`docs/reports/waymo_motion_failure_study.md`](../reports/waymo_motion_failure_study.md)
- Failure distribution stability study:
  [`docs/reports/waymo_motion_failure_stability.md`](../reports/waymo_motion_failure_stability.md)
- Cross-shard failure stability study:
  [`docs/reports/waymo_motion_failure_stability_cross_shard.md`](../reports/waymo_motion_failure_stability_cross_shard.md)
- Shard expansion plan:
  [`docs/reports/waymo_motion_shard_plan.md`](../reports/waymo_motion_shard_plan.md)

The current local evidence includes the original 75-scenario windowed study and
a true cross-shard run over four validation shards, covering 100 real scenarios
and 418 evaluated prediction targets. The cross-shard report shows mean FDE
varying from 21.20 m to 28.89 m across sampled shards, with cyclist interaction
the most variable shared tag.

## Why It Matters

Autonomy teams need tooling that finds where average-case performance hides
long-tail weaknesses. ScenarioLens demonstrates that workflow on public-data
boundaries: ingest a slice, score the scenario, evaluate a baseline, group the
failures, and produce reviewable evidence.

## Next Step

Expand beyond shards `00007` through `00010`, then use the hardest scenario ids
from the cross-shard report as candidates for lane-aware analysis and a small
Waymax/JAX replay prototype.
